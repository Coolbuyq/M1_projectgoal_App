 # Documentation is also done for the project with Doxygen
 # All Codacy, Codiga, Unity, Dynamic Check, Static Check, Linux build is done

 #### **Implementation is done and the file runs succesfully**

#### **The Architecture  (Behavioural, Structural) both high and low level is also created**
