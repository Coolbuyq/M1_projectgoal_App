## Requirements
 In Covid 19 the requirement of vaccination became necessary, so Government created a central server for vaccination purpose.But due to the large amount of traffic the central    server is crashing, so in order to decrease the traffic i created alocal server to register the data locally so that in the end of the day we can upload the data of people registered,vaccinated,no of viles used and total number of people that have been vaccinated on the respected days.By doing this it helps in maintaining the traffic properly and avoid unnecessary issues.
 
 Maintaining the local data helps in resolving issues and irrespective of central server, the work can be done even if the site works or not.This helps in continuous flow of work and increases the speed of productivity of vaccination.
 
 The local server stores the data of 1000 people after verification and confirmation of ADHAAR Number,Phone Number and stores the data in the local server.Hence forth it can be used in future for any further reference.
